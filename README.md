An IEEE‑style journal paper was developed as part of the university curriculum, titled “Redesigning the WSPR‑SDR to Operate on 5V Power and Support Direct USB Output.” This project involved analysing the limitations of the existing WSPR‑SDR architecture, proposing a low‑power redesign, and implementing modifications to enable efficient 5V operation and seamless USB connectivity. 

The paper documents the engineering processes — from system requirements and circuit redesign to testing, validation, and performance evaluation — demonstrating both technical depth and practical problem‑solving in embedded systems and radio communication technologies.
